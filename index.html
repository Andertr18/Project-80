            <p><strong>Mission Statement:</strong> Helping pitchers and catchers succeed on and off the field.</p>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Allow athletes to put themselves in a position to be successful and reach their goals.</p>
            <p><strong>What is Project 80?</strong> Project 80 is a training organization designed to help pitchers and catchers get to 80 mph and progress from there. The concept is simple: 80 mph is where college coaches begin showing interest. Once there, every MPH gain is a celebration, continuing the pursuit of the athlete’s goals.</p>
